# IPCV_Project

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the dataset. (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection)

This project focuses on the detection and classification of brain tumors using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) through the application of advanced image processing and deep learning techniques. Employing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the project encompasses data preprocessing, model training, and validation to develop an automated system for accurate tumor detection and segmentation.

The data used in this study consists of MRI scans labeled as either containing a tumor or not, sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection.

Submitted as a part of the Image Processing and Computer Vision course in HFU supervised by Professor Leonardo Noriega.
